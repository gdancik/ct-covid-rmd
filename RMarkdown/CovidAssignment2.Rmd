## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r covid}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
covid <- read_csv("https://data.ct.gov/resource/bfnu-rgqt.csv")
View(covid)
head(covid)
colnames(covid)

covid <- covid %>% arrange(dateupdated)

# plot cases over time
covid_plot <- ggplot(covid, aes(dateupdated, totalcases, color = county)) +
  geom_line() + theme_classic() + xlab('')
covid_plot
# get the most recent date
beginDate <-9 first(covid$dateupdated)
beginDate
format.Date(beginDate, '%m/%d/%Y')

lastDate <- last(covid$dateupdated)
lastDate
# formats the date 
format.Date(lastDate, '%m/%d/%Y')
covid_plot

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
